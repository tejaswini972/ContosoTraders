## Solution Architecture

Contoso Traders is a 2 tier application and consists of Client tier.

Presentation tier conatins the React JS application that acts as a client, collects the the information given by the user and passes it to Database tier. It consists of a collection of small, autonomous services. Each service is self-contained and should implement a single business capability within a bounded context. A bounded context is a natural division within a business and provides an explicit boundary within which a domain model exists.

Backend tier consists of 3 API components that are containerized.

1. Shopping Cart: An Azure containerized app 
2. Produtcs &Inventory: Contains a kubernetes cluster
3. Image Search: Containerized app service.

The workflow named Contoso-traders-infra-provisioning.yml will invoke the Bicep template that deploys the ACI app and AKS cluster.

### MICROSERVICES

Microservices are a popular architectural style for building applications that are resilient, highly scalable, independently deployable, and able to evolve quickly.
